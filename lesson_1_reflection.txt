How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    check the "+" or "-" before lines

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Not every revision is a good one, so easy access to history of a file is a big help.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros are they obey logical rules so tracking back would be a lot easier. cons are that I need to remember to create commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In order to make related files work well together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    go to the repository directory, git log, find the commit, quit, git dif, choose two commits, check.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    use git checkout to find where the bug was introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Control my project.
