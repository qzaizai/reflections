When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Share with other hosts.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I just want some of the changes but not all.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: for repository, Github host to Github host. Clone: For repository and ?, github to local or local to local. Branches: Add local branch to master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If there is a conflict, I can compare the local last known state and the new version for a manual merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Save files locally. Using GitHub would be easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    To add new feature and share with other people. In this way it is safer and easier to collaborate.
